## SnapThunder

### About
SnapThunder is My private modification for SnapChat (Android). It uses techniques that won't be named to inject into the SnapChat app and load extended functionality and features. It's previously known as [ZenSnap](https://github.com/SinfulZen/ZenSnap) which has been discontinued due to SnapChat's fight against modifications. I'm now going to be developing SnapThunder which will be more lightweight, safer to use and more feature rich.

### Compatability
As SnapChat is now taking third party applications and modifications seriously, things like FM Snap, SnapEnhance and ZenSnap are now easily detectable (on newer versions of the app). To prevent this, SnapThunder does as much as it can to spoof the app version and anything that can be flagged on SnapChat's systems. This allows the User to use an up-to-date version of the app with very minimal risks. I recommend using SnapChat V12.86.0.44 minimum when signing into Your account (before updating to a later version).  

### Download
If You'd like to download the APK (UI only), You can find it in the releases section or [here](#).  

### Warnings
As mentioned above, using without caution can put Your account at risk. When this mod is made public, be sure to be as careful as possible as I DO NOT take any responsibility if accounts get temporarily, permanently locked or disabled.  

### Notes
For now, only the general app look and feel is being worked on. As the app is being developed in Kotlin, JavaScript, Dark and ReactNative, I'm using HTML and CSS as a base design so I can test out the GUI, UI and UX.
