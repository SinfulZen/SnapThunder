### About SnapThunder
SnapThunder is a mofification of the SnapChat app for Android (both non rooted and rooted devices). It is packed with features that allow the User to fully enhance the app and add extended functionality. SnapThunder comes in quite a few forms, such as:
- Standalone app (SnapChat): Everything is built into the SnapChat APK.
- Manager: A separate APK with everything included.
- Core: The core features of SnapThunder in a singular APK (used for patching).
- Injection: A tool that allows the User to inject only certain things directly into the SnapChat app or into a custom core file.

### Notes
- Please note that what's included in the repo currently, are just test designs for the actual mod. It's currently private and used by the SZ Developments Team only. We will consider releasing the mod publicly if:
  - This repo gets enough attention
  - More People request the mod
 
- Only a few People are working on this project (for now). Me ([Sinful Zen](https://github.com/SinfulZen/SnapThunder)), is the only one working on the test designs which is what this repo contains. The SnapThunder APK can be downloaded but it is only the user interface and general layout of what the actual manager looks like.

### Warnings
SnapChat has taken a stand against 3rd party modifications and applications. They can easily detect the use of most SnapChat mods. As SnapThunder uses different techniques to hide its presence, SnapChat shouldn't be able to detect it as easily. Unlike SnapMod or SnapEnhance, SnapThunder uses a multiple step process which prevents any detection triggers in the SnapChat app. However, like all other Android mods, it's not 100% safe and never will be. The Team working on the mod are doing everything possible to make SnapThunder the most safest and reliable to use with no risks at all.
