## SnapThunder

### About
SnapThunder is My private modification for SnapChat (Android). It uses techniques that won't be named to inject into the SnapChat app and load extended functionality and features. It's previously known as [ZenSnap](https://github.com/SinfulZen/ZenSnap) which has been discontinued due to SnapChat's fight against modifications. I'm now going to be developing SnapThunder which will be more lightweight, safer to use and more feature rich.

### Compatability
I recommend using SnapChat V11.X.X.X minimum when signing into Your account (before updating to a later version).  

SnapChat is now taking third party applications and modifications seriously, things like FM-Snap, SnapEnhance and ZenSnap are now easily detectable (on newer versions of the app). To prevent this, SnapThunder does as much as it can to spoof the app version and anything that can be flagged on SnapChat's systems. This allows the User to use an up-to-date version of the app with very minimal risks. Spoofing and protection will be included as features that can be toggled in future development.  

### Download
If You'd like to download the APK (UI only), You can find it in the releases section or [here](https://github.com/SinfulZen/SnapThunder/releases/download/1.0.0/SnapThunder-UI.apk). More sources for downloading will be added in the future!

### Warnings
As mentioned above, using without caution can put Your account at risk. When this mod is made public (read below when), be sure to be as careful as possible as I DO NOT take any responsibility if accounts get temporarily, permanently locked or disabled.  

### Notes
- For now, only the general app look and feel is being worked on. As the app is being developed in Kotlin, JavaScript (& ReactNative) and Dark, I'm using HTML and CSS as a base design so I can test out the GUI, UI and UX.
- If the mod is made public in the future, I'll release several methods on how to use it. As it is now, the mod is an injection process but I may work on a standalone app (everything built into the SnapChat APK). I may also release a simple tool so that People can choose a SnapChat APK and patch with a SnapThunder build of Their choice. This allows extended customisation fitted to the User's needs!

### Feature Suggestions
If You have any features You'd like to be added, feel free to use My contact info below or open an issues.  

### FAQ  
<details closed>
  <summary>When will the actual mod be made public?</summary>
   
`It depends on how much attention the project gets. There's no point in releasing something if People aren't interested in it.`

</details>

<details closed>
  <summary>Why should I choose SnapThunder?</summary>
   
`That's a great question! For those who use SnapEnhance, SnapThunder is quite similar but is more lightweight, feature rich and safer to use.`

</details>

<details closed>
  <summary>How risky is it to use?</summary>
   
`SnapChat is now taking a stand against 3rd party installments and modifications. SnapThunder ensures that Your account won't be flagged. Of course it's not 100% fool-proof but I'd say 99% is good enough!`

</details>
