## SnapThunder

### About
SnapThunder is My private modification for SnapChat (Android). It uses techniques that won't be named (due to People stealing My work) to inject into the SnapChat app and load extended functionality and features. It's previously known as [ZenSnap](https://github.com/SinfulZen/ZenSnap) which has been discontinued due to SnapChat's fight against modifications. I'm now going to be developing SnapThunder which will be more lightweight, safer to use and more feature rich.  

### Features  
Please note that the features listed below are what My mod currently has. I'll update this section every time I add a new feature or if something changes. There's currently 133 features!

### Compatability
I recommend using SnapChat V11.3.X.X minimum when signing into Your account (before updating to a later version). SnapChat 12.35.0.31 and upwards are versions that have security and integrity checks integrated (SnapThunder works best on 11.3.X.X+).  

SnapChat is now taking third party applications and modifications seriously. Things like FM-Snap, SnapEnhance and ZenSnap are now easily detectable (on newer versions of the app). To prevent this, SnapThunder does as much as it can to spoof the app version and anything that can be flagged on SnapChat's systems. This allows the User to use an up-to-date version of the app with very minimal risks. Spoofing and protection are features that can be toggled, allowing You to fully protect Yourself!  

### Testing

Please note that the SnapChat versions listed above have been tested manually and are the most stable to use along with SnapThunder. Obviously there will be many other versions that will work great but these are the versions I've tested personally. When the SnapThunder Discord server is complete, I'll set up a channel where Members can post about versions They've tested or want to be tested. I will also get around to making an auto tester (a script that tests SnapThunder on as many SnapChat versions as possible).

### Warnings
As mentioned above, using without caution can put Your account at risk. When this mod is made public (read below when), be sure to be as careful as possible as I DO NOT take any responsibility if accounts get temporarily, permanently locked or disabled.  

### Notes
- For now, only the general app look and feel is being worked on. As the app is being developed in Kotlin, JavaScript (& ReactNative) and Dark, I'm using HTML and CSS as a base design so I can test out the GUI, UI and UX.
- If the mod is made public in the future, I'll release several methods on how to use it. As it is now, the mod is an injection process but I may work on a standalone app (everything built into the SnapChat APK). I may also release a simple tool so that People can choose a SnapChat APK and patch with a SnapThunder build of Their choice. This allows extended customisation fitted to the User's needs!

### Feature Suggestions

### FAQ  
<details closed>
  <summary>When will the actual mod be made public?</summary>
   
`It depends on how much attention the project gets. There's no point in releasing something if People aren't interested in it.`

</details>

<details closed>
  <summary>Why should I choose SnapThunder?</summary>
   
`That's a great question! For those who use SnapEnhance, SnapThunder is quite similar but is more lightweight, feature rich and safer to use.`

</details>

<details closed>
  <summary>How risky is it to use?</summary>
   
`SnapChat is now taking a stand against 3rd party installments and modifications. SnapThunder ensures that Your account won't be flagged. Of course it's not 100% fool-proof but I'd say 99% is good enough!`

</details>

<details closed>
  <summary>How do I suggest a feature?</summary>
   
`By getting in contact using the info at the bottom of the description or opening an issue.`

</details>

<details closed>
  <summary>Can I get in contact with the Developer?</summary>
